This beer originated in the Westphalia region of Germany in a town named Dusseldorf. Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage. We use a bit of Cascade hop to give it an “American Twist” while maintaining its German heritage. This beer won a Gold Medal at the 2011 and 2016 GABF and a Bronze at the 2012 GABF.

They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres.

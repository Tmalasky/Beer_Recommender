## Purpose - Background & Topic Selection Reasoning
Craft beer is becoming increasing demanded by consumers in todays market. Consumers willingness to spend more on variety, flavor and quality has increased since its beginnings in the 1960s. Craft beer is typically made with higher quality ingredients, which provides consumers with a more flavorful and distinctive tasting beer than mass-produced options. Those reaching for a craft beer often want a variety of flavors and to try new things and that craft brews really help beer not lose more market shares over the last decade. The association said the number of operating craft breweries in the U.S. reached an all-time high in 2021 of 9,118. We have come together as a team to help with the biggest question when it comes to beer, "Which one should I get?".
